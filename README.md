# SOFA HRTF Starter Pack

This is an easy-to-run set of starter files to start working with HRTFs encoded in the SOFA (**S**patially **O**riented **F**ormat for **A**coustics) format using the Python scripting language. It installs pysofaconventions using pip and allows for easy downloading of SOFA files if they're all stored together on an HTTP directory. This is optimized to be run on the [Machine Learning Data Science Platform](https://datahub.ucsd.edu/) on UCSD's supercomputer clusters, but using this should also set up a local installation just fine.

## Instructions

1. Upload the four files in this repository to your project directory (3 .ipynb files, 1 .py file).
2. Run the three Jupyter notebooks (.ipynb) in order.
3. ???
4. Convergence!
