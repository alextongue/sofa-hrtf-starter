# SOFA HRTF Starter Pack

This is an easy-to-run set of starter files to start working with HRTFs in the SOFA format. It installs a package in pip and allows for easy downloading of SOFA files if they're all stored together on an HTTP directory. This is optimized to be run on UCSD's supercomputer clusters ([datahub.ucsd.edu](datahub.ucsd.edu)), but using this should also set up a local installation just fine.

## Instructions

1. Upload the four files in this folder to your project directory.
2. Run the three Jupyter notebooks (.ipynb) in order.
3. ???
4. Convergence!
